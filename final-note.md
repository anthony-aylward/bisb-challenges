  ## Final note on URM students

.right-column[
As a final note, attracting more URM students to BISB should begin with
ensuring robust and reliable support for degree progress and mental health,
for all students. When there are gaps in support, URM students suffer
from them more frequently than others, so they are attentive to these
things when they decide where they will enroll.
